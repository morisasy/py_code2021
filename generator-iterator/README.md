#Iterators And Generators
  ***Iterables*** are objects that can return one of their elements at a time, such as a list. Many of the built-in functions such as 'enumerate,' return an iterator.

  An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data. This is different from a list, which is also an **iterable**, but is not an iterator because it is not a stream of data.

##Generators
 - Asimple way to create iterators using functions.
 - You can also define iterators using classes
